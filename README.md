I used redux to work with data. I get data from store with the help of mapToStateProps function. Because of it is dummy data i did not save it to AsyncStorage. For navigation i used stack navigation and it's header to display on which screen you are. If i had a little extra time i would divide codes to components(CustomBtn, UserList etc.) and complete search bar filter for user names.
